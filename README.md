# Somethings to be aware

1. The System verifies if you are inserting a valid social media user when given a username and url
2. This is a MVP I am still working on extra features but for now this will do
3. I am accepting pull requests so if you want to contribute to this project you are more than welcome

# Purpouse of this project
